Follow the next steps to run the Peer-to-Peer chat application
1. Make sure you have a recent jre installed on all the computers that the app is to be run on.
2. Open the P2P.jar file on all computers (this has been tested on Windows 8.1)
3. Start one peer by only entering a username and pressing enter. Take note of the IP of this computer on the local network.
4. On another computer, enter a different username and the ip of the first computer - you will be connecting to this computer. Now press enter.
5. The main window on each computer should now display the username and IP of the other computer. Double click on this username to start a chat.
6. You can create a channel by typing a channel name in the Create Channel input box and pressing enter. Clicking on a Peer's name will display the channels they own.
7. Connecting a third computer to the network involves completing the steps for connecting the second computer again on a third machine.
8. When a third peer connects to either of the current peers, his name will show up on both of their windows.
9. Channels may be joined by clicking on the peer's username in the main window, and then double clicking on one of their channels.

NOTE: you cannot make a connection to localhost, this has been intentionally disabled.
